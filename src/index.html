              <b>Kiss/Crash</b> is a multi-screen work exploring the subject of
              AI-imagery and representation as well as the autobiographical
              themes of loneliness, desire, and intimacy in the digital age. The
              installation consists of three individual works in a shared space,
              <i>Kiss/Crash</i>, <i>Me Kissing Me</i>, and
              <i>Crash Me, Gently</i>, which all play with augmenting,
              inverting, and negating the iconic image of the kiss using AI
              image translation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Repurposing a <i>classic Hollywood</i> aesthetic, the piece
              reflects on the nature of images and places AI models within a
              history of image-production technologies. In the process, it
              reveals the logic of AI imagery and hints at how
              <i>our relationship to reality</i> will continue to be stretched
              and shaped by artificial representations at an accelerating pace.

            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p>
              In a world already drowning in images, the oncoming tidal wave of
              AI-generated “art” is reason for pause if not outright concern.
              This is not just because of the ethical questions underlying the
              technology, but because images are incredibly powerful: their
              ability to entertain, delight, and inspire is matched by their
              potential to misinform, control, and incite.
            </p>

            <p>
              Susan Sontag addresses this point directly in
              <i>On Photography</i> when she describes our modern relationship
              to images as follows:
            </p>
            <div class="blockquote">
              <div class="blockquote_spacer"></div>
              <p>
                A society becomes modern when one of its chief activities is
                producing and consuming images, when images that have
                extraordinary powers to determine
                <i>our demands upon reality</i>, and are themselves coveted
                substitutes for firsthand experience, become indispensable to
                the health of the economy, the stability of the polity, and the
                pursuit of private happiness.
              </p>

              <div class="blockquote_spacer"></div>
            </div>
            <p>
              If we are to accept that images have these extraordinary powers,
              how will a technology which can generate endless images in an
              instant impact our economy, polity, and pursuit of happiness? And,
              how then, are artists expected to use this technology responsibly?
            </p>
            <p class="margin_btm_0">
              While there is no right answer, we’d benefit greatly by
              recognizing that this technology is revolutionary in its
              capabilities, but familiar in the questions it raises about the
              nature of images, representation and authenticity. This project
              attempts to continue a long tradition of artists repurposing
              image-making technologies, such as Dada and Pop artists, by asking
              how AI image generation can be twisted on itself to reveal
              something true about AI-imagery and our digital culture in
              general.

            <h3>Individual Works</h3>
            <p class="work_title"><b>Kiss/Crash</b></p>
            <p>
              In this piece, a car crash is turned into a kiss using AI image
              translation. The initial video used is a test crash of a classic
              1950’s car. Over a minute in length, the cars repeatedly crash
              into each other. Each time the colliding metal transforms into
              faces pressed together and the sound of the crash smoothly
              transitions into a romantic song rich in Hollywood nostalgia. As
              the video progresses, the impacts crescendo in speed and
              intensity, and the image translations become more erotic, violent
              and unhinged until finally the tension is released and the
              original slow-motion video of the crash plays with no translation
              applied.

            <p>
              In <i>Me Kissing Me</i>, the artist engaged in a slow romantic
              kiss with a mirror image of himself on a desolate black
              background. The slow-motion kiss is translated via AI-generation
              into augmented and perverted versions of the original scene,
              seamlessly transforming the artist and his double into various
              kissing couples such as cinematic lovers, religious idols,
              political celebrities, and uncanny creatures. Beneath the
              AI-generated romances, the underlying video of the artist kissing
              himself gently fades in and out, reminding the viewer of the
              artificial nature of the generated romance.

            <p class="work_title"><b>Crash Me, Gently</b></p>
            <p>
              <i>Crash Me, Gently</i> is an interactive installation, this time
              transforming a kiss into a crash. Here a vintage television loops
              a video of the artist kissing himself which transforms into a
              smooth Hollywood kiss whenever the faces meet. Viewers are invited
              to accelerate a foot pedal placed in front of the TV which
              increases the intensity of the images, causing them to become more
              cinematic, but also increasingly disjointed, pornographic, and
              violent. Contexts blend together as celebrities, creatures, and
              images of destruction take the place of the central lovers. The
              audio also accelerates, with sounds of metal crashing whenever the
              couple’s lips meet. The image becomes increasingly destabilized
              until the pedal is released, after which the TV returns to its
              calm loop.

            <h3>Themes</h3>
            <p><b>Simulated Arousal</b></p>
            <p>
              The central video of <i>Kiss/Crash</i> points to the power of
              images by creating a suggestive metaphor between two seemingly
              unrelated, but ubiquitous images from western media: the car crash
              and the kiss. By appropriating its aesthetic from classic
              Hollywood, an industry which brands itself as the dream factory,
              this piece aims to relate AI-imagery to a history of image
              production technologies meant to incite our desires through
              artificial representations.
            </p>
            <p>
              The anticipated experience of the viewer is one of arousal as they
              watch the crash repeatedly turned into an intimate scene, an
              experience reinforced by the acceleration of the video’s rhythm
              and sexualized, violent content. But that desire, both in this
              work and in our culture in general, is fueled, homogenized and
              repurposed by artificial representations. The generated desire is
              real. The images are not. The audience is left to consider the way
              fictional representations in media can arouse intense desires,
              ones that can never be satisfied and might entirely exclude whole
              sets of people, and the way AI-generated content may continue that
              tradition.
            </p>

            <p><b>Desire and Loneliness in Artificial Space</b></p>
            <p>
              Both <i>Me Kissing Me</i> and <i>Crash Me, Gently</i>, highlight
              the contrast between the individual experience of loneliness and
              the desire for authentic, sensuous experiences with others. In
              both these pieces, the isolated central figure is in a cold
              mirrored kiss with himself, which is repeatedly transformed into a
              warm sensual scene. In these pieces the self is quite literally
              projected into romanticized representations, visually
              demonstrating the ways we subconsciously see ourselves in
              fictional images.
            </p>
            <p>
              In <i>Me Kissing Me</i>, the process of image translation becomes
              visible as the original figures fade in and out of various
              generated poses, revealing the way AI tools can easily manipulate
              digital surfaces. These augmentations have the potential to be
              incredibly beautiful but can also feel quite shallow, like a thin,
              seductive veneer which obscures the identity of the original. In
              that sense, they become illustrative of our increasingly mediated
              relationship to reality in the digital era. One gets a sense of
              the way AI translation will stand between the original and our
              perception of it, especially with the specter of the metaverse on
              the horizon.

              The central aspect of <i>Crash Me, Gently</i> is its interactivity
              which invites the viewer to use the foot pedal to accelerate the
              intensity of the experience. The viewer becomes complicit in the
              hunt for more exaggerated representations of "love". The frenetic
              changes of context as the pedal is pressed, including the
              fast-paced mixture of violence, sex, celebrity and disaster,
              mimics the increasing schizophrenia of the digital world. The
              immediate result of pressing the pedal and being bombarded with
              these sensual scenes is perversely satisfying, but also questions
              the way desire can be aroused by representations while never truly
              being satisfied.

              All these pieces hint at the underlying logic of AI-imagery and
              suggest the way artificial representations may increasingly stand
              in for real sensations in the future.

            <h3>Closing Remarks</h3>
            <p>
              Susan Sontag, writing 50 years before the arrival of AI imagery,
              made the following call to action which seems just as relevant
              today, if not more so:
            </p>
            <!-- <div class="pullquote">
              Images are more real than anyone could have supposed.
            </div> -->
            <div class="blockquote">
              <div class="blockquote_spacer"></div>
              <p>
                <i>Images are more real than anyone could have supposed.</i> And
                just because they are an unlimited resource, one that cannot be
                exhausted by consumerist waste, there is all the more reason to
                apply the conservationist remedy. If there can be a better way
                for the real world to include the one of images, it will require
                an ecology not only of real things but of images as well.

              This project began with concern for the oncoming flood of
              artificial images, but my ultimate goal with this project was to
              consider the ways we can use artificial images in a
              self-reflective way which heightens our sense of the real. My hope
              is that instead of creating more visual waste, I've added to the
              "worthwhile ecology of images": an addition that doesn’t further
              drown us in the flood, but instead helps us float to the surface
              where we can feel the sun on our skin.

            <h3>Artist Bio</h3>
            <p>
              Adam is an American new media artist working at the intersection
              of art and technology. He is currently based in the UK and
              recently completed his master's at the Creative Computing
              Institute, University of the Arts London. His work spans both the
              digital and physical and focuses on the various ways identity and
              intimacy are mediated through technology. Using an innovative
              computational practice, he explores these themes using
              microprocessors, 3D rendering engines, creative coding algorithms,
              and AI networks. With a keen interest in the history of images,
              Adam's work attempts to continue a queer tradition of twisting
              popular media conventions to discover unspoken double meanings.
